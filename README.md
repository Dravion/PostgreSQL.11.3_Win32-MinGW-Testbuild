# PostgreSQL.11.3_Win32-MinGW-Testbuild
Custom build for PostgreSQL 10.8 and later


This is a Windows build of the PostgreSQL Database server, compiled on LINUX for Windows.
The goal was to checkout if this will run on WinXP 32-Bit vanilla (RTM) but it failed.
PostgreSQL 10 is the latest version which works on Windows XP vanilla.
