This ist Cross compilation test of the PostgreSQL Database server, version 11.3
with  build target Windows 7 SP1 (32-Bit). It runs also on any Windows 64-Bit Systems (x86_64) 
with the WOW64 (Windows on Windows) Compatbility layer like most nowdays 32-Bit Win32 Programs.

#Instructions
This howto was tested with Ubuntu19 (just commandline, no X11 Graphical Userinterface) 
using default Distro built in packages only, except a GIT checkout of PostgreSQL 11.3 sources

#Start 
sudo apt-get install mingw-w64 bison flex libreadline-dev zlib1g-dev
git clone https://git.postgresql.org/git/postgresql.git

cd postgresql 
./configure --host=i686-w64-mingw32 --without-zlib
make all

Now you can check with find . -name "*.exe" and find . -name "*.dll" all binary files
for Windows 32-Bit where built correctly. It was a bit of a tedious quest to trial and error
requested support files but it was doable (you find the required files in the ZIP-Archive in the
Release section - https://github.com/Dravion/PostgreSQL.11.3_Win32-MinGW-Testbuild/releases/tag/11.3-Custom).

This Custom PostgreSQL binary build is only 12 MBytes big but if you run "initdb.exe" it will
be upto 90 MBytes in total.

#Startup
1)
SET PGDATA=C:\ProgramData\pgdata11.3   (C:\PrgramData\*.* is recommended because its writable)
2)
Unzip pg_11.3_win32.zip to pg_11.3_win32 and move it to C:\Program Files (x86)\pg_11.3_win32
3) 
 "C:\Program Files (x86)\pg_11.3_win32\pg_ctl -l logfile start"

Now your Postmaster Backendprocess should be avaiable and you can login with 
psql -d postgres + ENTER
